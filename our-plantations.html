						<p>"Simple ideas can make dreams come true, and the story of Mabroc starts off the way many great stories do; with a piping hot cup of tea. Mabroc was the brainchild of a small group of tea enthusiasts who had one simple idea: make the best tea Sri Lanka can produce, and gift it to the world. A conversation over a cup of tea birthed an idea which ultimately became the identity of the largest producer of tea in Sri Lanka, as well as a global presence that supplies the finest Ceylon teas to people in more than 50 countries around the world."</p>

						<p>Since its beginning in 1988, Mabroc has climbed its way to the highest echelons of the tea industry thanks to a passionate commitment to quality, excellence, and sustainability. Today, the company functions as the marketing arm of Kelani Valley Plantations, Talawakelle Estates PLC, and Horana Plantations PLC; the plantation companies of Hayleys PLC owns 48 tea processing factories. Together they hold over 9,605 hectares of tea gardens which produce an annual output of 12.5 million kilograms of the finest Ceylon tea. With 44 tea gardens, 44 black tea factories, 3 green tea factories, and 1 instant tea factory, Mabroc has a competitive advantage of producing premium teas in bulk and customizing orders according to our client’s every specification.</p>

						<p>Mabroc’s tea gardens are certified by the Rainforest Alliance and conform to HACCP and ISO 22000:2005, ISO 9001:2008 as well as other international standards. All Mabroc operations are grounded on sustainable environmental and social practices to produce ethical teas that consumers can enjoy with a clear conscience. The company has consistently won awards for excellence, and the evidence of the company’s unparalleled performance is best illustrated by its position as the leading tea producer of Sri Lanka.</p>
